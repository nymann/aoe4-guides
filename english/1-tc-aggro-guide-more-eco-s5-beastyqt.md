# 1 TC Aggro guide (more eco)

Note: `< 00:21` means before 00:21 (but no earlier than previous step). `~` means roughly.

> You don't play english to build rams and push your opponent and kill, you play to mass units to force your opponent to mass units, so you are both stuck in feudal, which is where the game is good for you because you have longbows.<br><br> - Beastyqt

| Time | Food | Wood | Gold | Builders | Action | Note |
| ---  | ---  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00:01 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | All on sheep ||
| 00:03 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Move 2 from sheep to farm ||
| <00:21 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Rally on sheep ||
| <00:41 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Rally on gold ||
| 00:41 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Build House and Mining Camp at gold | The house shouldn't usually be on the side from the perspective of where the opponent is coming from, due to that being an ideal place for a potential tower |
| <01:01 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 1 | Rally on Mining Camp --> Gold | Optimization: Only needs a few taps from the second builder |
| 01:21 | 7 | 0 | 3 | 0 | Use the time between 01:01 and 1:41 to focus on scouting ||
| <01:41 | 7 | 0 | 3 | 0 | Rally on TC wood ||
| ~02:26 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | Build Council with 3 from food as soon as you can | Placement should be towards the enemy for safer farms (400F/200G) |
| 02:41 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | Build mill with 1 from wood ||
| ~03:15 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 | Build Lumber-camp with one from TC wood ||
| <03:21 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | Rally on closest TC wood-line||
| ~03:42 | 5 | 6 | 3 | 3 | Wheelbarrow when you have 150 gold ||
| 04:01 | 5 | 6 | 3 | 4 | Build 1 house with the new villager ||
| ~04:29 | 8 | 8 | 3 | 0 | Age up, move the builders from Council to sheep | Gradually add farms depending on sheep count (37w per farm). We never want to run out of sheep and move everything to farm all at once, since that's a big window without any food |
| ~04:29 | 8 | 8 | 3 | 0 | Queue 2 longbows if against civs without early production | Check table |
| ~04:51 | 8 | 9 | 3 | 0 | Get Double Broadaxe (50f/100g) ||
| ~04:58 | 8 | 8 | 3 | 1 | Build Barracks with one from wood | This will probably be a bit delayed in a real game, since you probably won't find this many sheep and as a result have to make some farms |
| ~05:21 | 8 | 10 | 3 | 1 | Queue up a house with the vil building barracks ||
| ~05:41 | 8 | 12 | 3 | 0 | Get Horticulture when available (50w/100g) ||
| ~06:21 | 9 | 13 | 3 | 0 | Move one from wood to farm ||
| ~06:40 | 9 | 12 | 3 | 1 | Build blacksmith with 1 from wood, then house. ||
| ~06:45 | 9 | 11 | 3 | 2 | Replenish Lumber Camp as necessary ||
| ~07:05 | 9 | 12 | 3 | 2 | Buy +1 ranged upgrade ||
| ~07:40 | 11 | 15 | 2 | 0 | Move one from gold to farm ||
| ~07:45 | 11 | 16 | 2 | 0 | Move out with your army | 4 spears, 11 longbows. If opponent have no units you can push out earlier, you can bring a villager to build a tower. |

The goal from here is to get to.


| Civ | Early Production |
| --- | --- |
| Abbasid Dynasty | No |
| Chinese | No |
| Delhi Sultanate | Potentially |
| English | Yes, but go for it |
| French | Yes |
| Holy Roman Empire | No |
| Malians | No |
| Mongols | Yes |
| Ottomans | No |
| Rus | Yes |

## Upgrade order

- Wheel Barrow
- Broad Axe
- Horticulture
- +1 ranged attack
- +1 ranged armor
- Bloomery
- Fitted Leatherwork
- Siege Engineering (which you won't need super early)

## Unit counts

15-16 wood, that'll be enough to produce constantly and eventually build a second barracks (you need 8 to sustain production alone, 16 would mean ~38 wood/min in surplus). If you eventually wanna go rams, you need 21 (22 without forestry) on wood.

12 farms are needed to constantly produce villagers, longbows and spearmen.

At 20 on food, make another barracks.

### What do I need ressources for?

#### Other than production, what do we need food for?

| Name | Food |
| --- | --- |
| Council Hall | 400 |
| Forestry? | 25 |
| Bloomery | 50 |
| Fitted Leatherwork | 50 |

So in other words we need ~100 food in the bank for upgrades.

##### After getting the upgrades

| Production | Food | Wood | Gold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| villager, longbow | 7 | 6 | 0 |
| villager, longbow, spearman | 12 | 8 | 0 |
| villager, longbow, men at arms | 15 | 6 | 2 |
| villager, longbow, men at arms, spearman | 20 | 8 | 2 |
| villager, longbow, 2 men at arms | 23 | 6 | 4 |

So in other words, everytime we are thinking about adding a barracks and want to produce MAA then we need +8 food, +2 gold. And for spearment it's +5 food +2 wood.

## Army

If you go out with 2 longbows early, just attack a bit and move back. We just want to force the opponent to make production (see quote).

When moving out ~07:45 it's extremely important that you have the mindset of denying the opponents food, not going for his TC. Just deny the food and they won't be able to produce anything after a while.

### What to attack?

Against HRE go food, if not against HRE, the woodline is also good to attack.

## Review stuff

### Villager Count check

Villagers produce every 20 seconds, using a 1 second delay at start of games here's how many villagers we should have.

| Time | Villager count |
| --- | --- |
| 0:00 | 6 |
| 0:21 | 7 |
| 0:41 | 8 |
| 1:01 | 9 |
| 1:21 | 10 |
| 1:41 | 11 |
| 2:01 | 12 |
| 2:21 | 13 |
| 2:41 | 14 |
| 3:01 | 15 |
| 3:21 | 16 |
| 3:41 | 17 |
| 4:01 | 18 |
| 4:21 | 19 |
| 4:41 | 20 |
| 5:01 | 21 |
| 5:21 | 22 |
| 5:41 | 23 |
| 6:01 | 24 |
| 6:21 | 25 |
| 6:41 | 26 |
| 7:01 | 27 |
| 7:21 | 28 |
| 7:41 | 29 |
| 8:01 | 30 |
| 8:21 | 31 |
| 8:41 | 32 |
| 9:01 | 33 |
| 9:21 | 34 |
| 9:41 | 35 |

Another way to remember this is just:

```py
minutes*3+(second_index)+6
```

By `second_index` I mean `01 = 0`, `21 = 1`, `41 = 2`. So fx 7:21

```py
7*3+1+6 = 21 + 7 = 28
```
